# Canva
I made this using HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. Where I made canvas to draw anything you want. 

How the Game Works:
Drawing on the Canvas:

Use your mouse or finger to scribble. Press and hold to start drawing, then drag to create lines.
For mobile devices, use touch gestures to scribble on the canvas.
Clear the Canvas:

To clear the canvas, click the "Clear" button below the canvas. This will erase everything.
Responsive Design:

The canvas automatically adjusts to different screen sizes. On smaller devices, it will fit the screen width so you can easily draw on a phone or tablet.
